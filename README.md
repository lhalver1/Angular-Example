# AngularJS Examples

This is me having fun with Angular and Twitter Bootstrap

In here there are examples of the built in Angular Router, Angular Services, and much more.
I have built my own filter as well as using the default built in Angular filter to filter a
table.

All of these Angular features are seamlessly tied in with Bootstrap v3 and v4. The user has
the ability to switch which version of bootstrap they would like to use dynamically at any
point. I use bootstrap's helper classes to highlight the selected row and also highlight the
row when the user hovers over the row. Bootstraps grid system also came in handy when I needed
to make a layout for the Blackjack game.

This repository is a good deminstration, But Not Limited To, of some of my AngularJS and 
Bootstrap abilities. I absolutly love working with Angular and Bootstrap and I am always 
learning new ways to develop in both of these libraries.
